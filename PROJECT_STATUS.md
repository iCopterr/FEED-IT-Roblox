## 1. Current Goal

Build a playable prototype that validates:

**Hatch → Place → Earn → Farm → Feed → Grow → Risk → Explode / Survive**

The versioned data foundation and server-side pet foundation are implemented.
The immediate priority is runtime-testing PetService mutations, then building
pet placement and Pen ownership.

## 3. Current Feature

**Current Feature:** Pet Foundation

**Status:** 🟦 Implemented / Needs Testing

**Objective:** Create server-authoritative pets with immutable unique identity,
validated inventory mutations, six prototype species, and locked base-income values.

## 4. Completed

- Initialized a local Git repository using the `main` branch.
- Configured `origin` as `https://github.com/iCopterr/FEED-IT-Roblox.git`.
- Added a pinned Rojo toolchain definition and Rojo project file.
- Added minimal client, server, and shared source roots.
- Documented the Studio/Rojo ownership boundary and sequential-account workflow.
- Added repository ignore and line-ending rules.
- Installed Rokit 1.2.0 and the project-pinned Rojo 7.7.0.
- Installed the Rojo 7 Studio plugin for the current Windows user.
- Built `build/FeedYourPet.rbxlx` and launched the server on port 34872.
- Committed the foundation as `282e2d9` and pushed `main` to GitHub.
- Connected Roblox Studio MCP on port 58741 and identified the published place.
- Verified Rojo synchronized the client, server, and shared filesystem roots.
- Verified both bootstrap scripts execute in a one-player Studio test.
- Added centralized v1 player and pet data versions/defaults in `GameConfig`.
- Added a server-only `PlayerDataSchema` with typed player/pet contracts.
- Added strict validation for identity, placement slots, serializable settings,
  currencies, farm state, traits, statistics, and collection shapes.
- Added isolated default construction, deep cloning, and an explicit migration pipeline.
- Rejects unversioned, corrupt, or future-version data rather than silently rewriting it.
- Added centralized production/Studio store names, retry policy, autosave interval,
  session lease timeout, acquisition policy, and shutdown timeout in `DataConfig`.
- Added a DataStore adapter with bounded exponential retry and jitter.
- Studio defaults to process-local memory data; optional Studio persistence uses a
  separate test DataStore and cannot write to the production store name.
- Added `DataService` with atomic `UpdateAsync` load/migrate/session acquisition.
- Added unique per-load lease tokens, heartbeat refresh, stale-lock takeover, and
  fail-closed handling for active foreign sessions or malformed/future records.
- Added validated snapshots, serialized per-player save operations, 60-second
  autosave, final PlayerRemoving save/release, and concurrent shutdown saving.
- Added an idempotent last-session marker so a retried release can recognize a
  prior successful write even when the first response was ambiguous.
- The server now starts `DataService` from the Rojo-managed bootstrap.
- Added `PetConfig` with exactly one prototype species for each rarity and the
  GDD-locked base-income anchors: 10, 150, 500, 3,000, 10,000, and 45,000.
- Added `PetService` with server-generated GUID `PetId` values and authoritative
  species, Egg, rarity, Variant, traits, Feed Level, income, lock, placement, and timestamps.
- Added defensive GUID collision checks and full `PlayerDataSchema` validation
  with rollback after every pet mutation.
- Added snapshot-returning pet/inventory reads so callers cannot mutate identity
  through returned values.
- Added lock changes and conservative permanent removal: locked or placed pets
  cannot be removed, and Explosion is explicitly reserved for pending recovery.
- Added server-only PetAdded, PetRemoved, and PetChanged events.
- The server bootstrap now starts `PetService` after `DataService`.

## 5. In Progress

- Production DataStore persistence and cross-server session behavior still need
  an end-to-end test in a published test server or Studio with API access enabled.
- Data schema migrations beyond v1 will be added only when the schema version changes.
- PetService configuration and bootstrap were verified in Studio, but the full
  create/lock/remove mutation smoke test remains pending because Roblox MCP was
  unavailable after Studio restarted and Computer Use was stopped by user request.

## 6. Next Tasks

1. Run the prepared PetService behavior checks through Roblox MCP: create two
   pets, confirm unique IDs and snapshot isolation, lock/unlock, remove, and validate data.
2. Implement `PlotService` and server-authoritative pet placement/pickup with five slots.
3. Add simple prototype pet spawning/wandering in the Studio-owned Pen.
4. Verify pet identity, placement, Feed Level, and lock state survive a real DataStore rejoin.

## 7. Files Modified This Session

```text
src/server/Services/PetService.luau
src/server/init.server.luau
src/shared/Config/PetConfig.luau
PROJECT_STATUS.md
```

## 8. Current Uncommitted Work

None.

## 9. Known Issues / Blockers

- Studio Output contains unrelated RigEdit Plus outdated/plugin-icon warnings.
- Studio also reported a Game Settings SecurityPage JSON secrets parse warning.

These warnings do not block Rojo, MCP, or prototype development.

## 10. Architecture Notes

Planned server services:

```text
DataService
PetService
EggService
MoneyService
FarmService
FeedService
MonetizationService
PlotService
```

Planned client controllers:

```text
HUDController
InventoryController
EggController
FarmController
FeedController
CarryController
EffectsController
```

Create modules only when they gain a real responsibility. Do not generate empty
architecture merely to fill these lists.

Data architecture decisions:

- `PlayerDataSchema` is server-only; clients do not own or validate authoritative data.
- `Inventory` is a dictionary keyed by immutable `PetId`, never by array position.
- `PlacedPetIds` is a set, cross-validated with each pet's `Placed` and `PlotSlot` fields.
- Plot slots must be unique and within `MaxPetSlots`.
- Loaded current-version data is validated and cloned before use.
- New schema versions require an explicit migration function; future versions fail closed.
- One stored record owns both player data and its optional session lease so load,
  migration, lock acquisition, saves, and releases remain atomic under `UpdateAsync`.
- A lease is owned by both a server ID and a unique per-load session ID. Saves
  fail closed and disconnect the player if this server no longer owns that lease.
- Autosaves refresh the lease heartbeat every 60 seconds; a foreign lease becomes
  reclaimable after 180 seconds without a heartbeat.
- `LastSessionId` makes release idempotent after an unknown DataStore write result.
- Save operations for one player are serialized to prevent autosave, leave, and
  shutdown handlers from racing each other.

Pet architecture decisions:

- `PetService` exists only under `ServerScriptService`; clients cannot create,
  delete, lock, or choose authoritative pet results.
- `PetConfig` defines six placeholder prototype species and may be replaced with
  final species later without changing persistent pet identity rules.
- `CreatePet` derives all authoritative fields from configuration; callers provide
  only a known server-side `SpeciesId`.
- `GetPet` and `GetInventory` return deep pet snapshots, including cloned Traits.
- `PetIndex` records discovery and remains true after a pet leaves the inventory.
- Ordinary removal rejects locked and placed pets. Explosion must not call this
  path; it will use the future pending-recovery/Revive transaction.

## 11. Rojo / Studio State

**Rojo:** Rokit 1.2.0 and pinned Rojo 7.7.0 installed; build and serve verified.

**Studio Plugin:** Installed at `%LOCALAPPDATA%/Roblox/Plugins/RojoManagedPlugin.rbxm`.

**Studio Place:** `FeedYourPet`, place ID `127663486570625`, game ID `10766377691`.

**Studio Connection:** Rojo live sync verified on `localhost:34872`.

**MCP Connection:** Global `robloxstudio` MCP entry uses
`npx -y robloxstudio-mcp@latest` with `ROBLOX_STUDIO_PORT=58741`. A new Codex
task successfully reached the bridge, which reports server version 2.6.0. The
Studio Edit peer is connected and tool calls are verified.

Ownership boundary:

- `src/` contains filesystem/Rojo-managed code.
- The Roblox place contains Studio-managed world Instances.
- `default.project.json` intentionally maps only code roots, preventing two
  sources of truth for the prototype world.

## 12. Data / Persistence State

**DataVersion:** Player v1; Pet v1

**Persistence:** Implemented; Studio memory flow verified, live backend test pending

Stored records use wrapper version 1:

```text
RecordVersion, Data, Session, LastSessionId, LastSavedAt
```

The optional session lease stores:

```text
ServerId, SessionId, PlaceId, AcquiredAt, HeartbeatAt
```

Current v1 player fields:

```text
DataVersion, Money, Food, FarmLevel, FarmPower, MaxPetSlots,
Inventory, PlacedPetIds, PetIndex, Statistics, Settings
```

Each v1 pet preserves:

```text
DataVersion, PetId, SpeciesId, EggId, Rarity, Variant, Traits,
FeedLevel, BaseIncome, Locked, Placed, PlotSlot, CreatedAt
```

## 13. Current Feed Implementation

**Status:** Not implemented

Required authoritative resolution order remains:

```text
Food validation → Food deduction → Protection → Explosion roll
→ Explosion / survival → Critical roll after survival → Feed Level update
→ Income update → Visual growth → Persistence
```

## 15. Last Known Working State

No playable prototype state has been established. Git, Rojo, the bootstrap,
schema v1, DataService, and the server-side pet foundation are implemented.
Interactive pet mutation and live DataStore tests remain before full verification.

## 16. Last Working Git Commit

**Commit:** `5ca59a0`

**Message:** `feat: add server-authoritative pet foundation`

## 17. Important Decisions

- Prototype scope only; GDD v0.5 remains the design source of truth.
- Server-authoritative gameplay and persistent unique Pet IDs remain mandatory.
- Rojo-managed source is edited only in `src/`.
- The prototype world remains Studio-owned unless an explicit future migration
  places selected Instances under Rojo.
- Rojo is pinned with Rokit so sequential Codex sessions share one version.
- Git and `PROJECT_STATUS.md` are the cross-session recovery and handoff system.
- Only one Codex account or Studio editing session operates on this working copy
  at a time.

## 18. Session Handoff

### What Was Done

Implemented `PetConfig` and `PetService` with six prototype species, locked base
incomes, GUID identity, validated create/read/lock/remove operations, snapshots,
rollback safety, and server-only events. Added PetService to server startup.

### What Is Currently Incomplete

Interactive PetService mutation testing, pet placement/Pen ownership, simple
wandering, and live DataStore/cross-server lease testing.

### Next Agent Should

1. Read `AGENTS.md`, this file, and relevant GDD sections.
2. Run `git status` and `git diff`.
3. Run PetService mutation checks through Roblox MCP; do not use Computer Use.
4. Continue with PlotService and placement/pickup while preserving inventory and slot consistency.
5. Do not point Studio at production data; use the isolated Studio store for backend tests.
